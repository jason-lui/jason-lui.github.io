        <p>
            Hi my name is Jason Lui. I am 23 years old and I graduated from UBC with a degree in 
            biochemistry. I am currently enrolled in the Computer Systems Technology program at 
            BCIT. I decided to enroll here because I took a few computer science courses in my 
            final year at UBC and I enjoyed them a lot. I think that I will enjoy a career in 
            computer science rather than biochemistry.
        </p>

                        <p>
                            Information technology professionals spend time each day communicating 
                            orally and in writing with their supervisors, colleagues and clients. 
                            As problem-solvers and entrepreneurs in industry, you need to communicate 
                            quickly, clearly, and effectively. This course will teach you how to be a 
                            professional and efficient communicator at work. You will write effective 
                            business correspondence and instructions and deliver a formal oral 
                            presentation to your set. The first term establishes the principles 
                            and basic patterns on which you will build more advanced applications 
                            in the second term.

                    <p>
                        The course covers topics of importance to new and continuing students on 
                        how to balance school and related activities to enhance chances of success 
                        in their academic careers. In this course students will learn a variety of 
                        different techniques to improve study habits, note taking, and time management 
                        skills. The class will also present other topics of interest to CST students 
                        and will introduce students to various support systems at BCIT.

                    <p>
                        Comp 1113 is partially discrete mathematics, partially an introduction 
                        to linear equations. The purpose of this course is to give a strong 
                        foundation for future technical and programming courses. The course is 
                        divided into three parts: (1) Boolean algebra and design of logic circuits; 
                        (2) number systems and data representation; and (3) functions, linear 
                        equations, vectors and matrices.

                        This hands-on course is the foundation for all future programming courses 
                        and complements COMP 1536 and COMP 1910. This course introduces the fundamental 
                        concepts of programming including design, development, testing, debugging 
                        simple programs, as well as error-handling, and problem solving.

                        This course is a web design and programming course with an emphasis on good 
                        planning, interface design, multimedia, client-side scripting with JavaScript, 
                        server-side scripting, and best practices. COMP 1536 will provide students 
                        with a solid understanding about how web applications are constructed and 
                        deployed. Students will be taught to use client-side RAD tools in order to 
                        enhance their productivity. Students will complete a number of assignments 
                        and exams as well as one larger project.

                    <li>COMP 1712 - Business Analysis and System Design</li>
                    <p>
                        Business Analysis and Systems Design is the study of concepts, processes 
                        and tools that professionals use to plan and develop information systems to 
                        industry standards. Students learn how to ask implicit questions, to create 
                        and document communication plans and to make better decisions prior to creating 
                        a software system. Beginning with an introduction to the Software Development 
                        Life Cycle (SDLC), students work in teams to initiate the system process, 
                        analyze problems, discover requirements and create a logical design. Topics 
                        include: techniques used in the discovery of business requirements, traditional 
                        approaches to data and process modelling, entity-relationship diagrams, and an 
                        introduction to relational database normalization. Agile life cycles such as 
                        Scrum are also introduced and compared to more planned life cycles such as 
                        waterfall. By the end of this course, successful participants will be able to 
                        use tools and methods commonly used in industry to analyze, design, and implement 
                        information systems as confirmed by a term project.

                    <li>COMP 1930 - Projects 1</li>
                    <p>
                        Students learn to work in a collaborative environment and complete a small-scale 
                        software project: a web app. Design and managing of implementation concepts will 
                        be introduced: User Experience Design (XSD) and Agile methodology. The course 
                        takes students through the UX design process which includes creating and 
                        administering surveys & interviews, creating personas and user stories, designing 
                        wireframes, and performing user tests with a developed implementation that is 
                        based on the UX design process. Students will use the Agile methodology to manage 
                        the software process. Software management workflow also includes using version 
                        control, version control basics, utilizing web technologies (JavaScript, CSS, 
                        HTML, data persistence via NoSQL data technologies). Some of the JavaScript 
                        topics include DOM manipulation, event handling, web storage, AJAX calls and 
                        using JQuery in order to create a rich web app.
